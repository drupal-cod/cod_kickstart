# Welcome to cod!
COD, or Conference Organizing Distribution, is an installation profile for 
Drupal, that makes it easy to create a conference website with features 
like event signup, session proposal, session voting/judging, session 
selection/scheduling, and social networking prior to events. Read more 
about COD's features on usecod.com and https://www.drupal.org/project/cod

For the latest information related to the process of porting this
installation profile to D8, be sure to see https://www.drupal.org/node/2605232

# Features of cod
## Built on BLT and Lightning
Please see the [BLT documentation](http://blt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for information on build, testing, and deployment processes.

## Conference management
Create a new conference, with general time and location information, and 
registration options.  Site administrators can easily manage multiple
conferences with a custom interface.

## User registration
A walkthrough registration process makes it easy for new or existing users
to register for a conference.

If you wish to collect data from a person upon registration (such as meal 
preference) you can customize this using the webform module.  Collected webform
data can then be displayed in a table, or downloaded as a .csv file.

## Session scheduling
For each conference, organizers can propose and vote on sessions. A session is 
a topic of discussion for the conference, with a specific location and time 
slot for a day. Once a session is scheduled into the conference, members can 
note if they are attending that specific session.

Scheduled sessions are laid out in a calendar view for each day, with sessions 
marked in hourly blocks.  It can even handle multiple sessions scheduled at the 
same time, in different locations.

On the schedule page users can check off which sessions they will be attending 
and their personalized schedule will then appear on their profile for others 
to see.

# cod Terminology
In an effort to align expectations and discussions around what things are
and what they are supposed to do among the modules that help make cod, here
is a short list of key terms used throughout the project:

## Attendee
A registered user of the site who has signed up (via Ticket, below) to attend
a conference event. 

## Presenter
A registered user of the site who is also an attendee and has submitted a 
session to present at a conference event and that session has been approved
or selected.

## Sponsor
A registered user of the site who has paid additional specified amounts or 
supplied in-kind donations for a conference event. 

## Session
A topic of discussion or for presentation at a conference, with a specific 
location and time slot for a day. Within Drupal, this is a content type.

## Ticket
A means of qualifying registered users as conference attendees. If payment
is required for attending a conference event, the amount and different levels
of discounts can be specified.

## Event
All the conference sessions in one particular timeframe, e.g., Drupaldelphia 
2016, vs. Drupaldelphia 2018.

## Program
A group of conference sessions, assigned to locations and timeslots and daya.
